# bgDiscord
Python Discord script to do things, not just a bot, anything's possible really.
discord bot to do things that otherwise would require a human.
some ideas would be to create a badge system
    Interactive Jukebox
    in Game discord interaction
    Connect Jira or other to discord for task tracking and collaboration
    many other things fun things.

initially I just labeled this as bgDiscord out of a lack of a better name.
Ultimately I'm not really sure what I want to do with this yet.
Also Classes infuriate me. >:|
